![starburst-collibra](https://github.com/starburstdata/starburst-collibra/blob/main/starburst-collibra.png?raw=true)
This repository contains code for any integrations between Starburst and Collibra.  Each folder in this repository represents an integration.  Found within each folder is the code and any supporting files required to run that integration.  Integrations in this repository and considered community supported, so there are no SLAs from either Starburst nor Collibra for responding to issues or pull requests.  We will, however, do our best to address these items as soon as we can.
